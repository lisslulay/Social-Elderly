Due to the prototype's complexity and time limits, I only completed a portion of the page structure and functionalities, instead using images for unfinished pages.

The page with completed HTML and CSS:

[activities.html](pages\activities.html)  [activities-ongoing.html](pages\activities-ongoing.html)  [activities-series.html](pages\activities-series.html)  [people.html](pages\people.html)  [post.html](pages\post.html)  [video-with-arounds.html](pages\video-with-arounds.html)  [video-with-friends.html](pages\video-with-friends.html) 

- Completed function:

  - Global navigation

  - Breadcrumbs
  - Go to top
  - Create post
  - Video and invite friends and around people
  - Add friends
  - Close transcription

Pages using images instead:

 [activities-all.html](pages\activities-all.html)  [calendar.html](pages\calendar.html)  [mailbox.html](pages\mailbox.html)  [setting.html](pages\setting.html)
